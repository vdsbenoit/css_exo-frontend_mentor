## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind
- Vue 3 (composition API)
- Nuxt 3
- Prettier validation enforced

### What I learned

There isn't any native ways to format an `input` field of type `number`. 
In order to have a `,` separator between the thousands, one have to write some javascript code to format the `input` element and to format the value back to a `number` afterwards.
